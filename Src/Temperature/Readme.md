In this directory there are programs working with OneWire DS18b20 temperature sensors.
As always, I run these on my Shield Monster, on particular pic it is running [TemperatureMultipleSensorsToLCD.ino](TemperatureMultipleSensorsToLCD.ino)

Considering the tiny space on the LCD, not more sensors will fit.
Currently it seems, six is max (with over 100 and below 0 ban),
[00.0ø00.0ø00.0ø ]
